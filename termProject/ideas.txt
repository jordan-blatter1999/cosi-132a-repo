Game Reviews
    - [ ] With COVID-19  in place, the gaming industry saw a massive bump in its users. To keep the users hooked 
          to their games and not lose them to other entertainment options, the analysts have to keep track of the 
          customer reviews.
    - [ ] Project Idea: You can do a web scraping project with the data available on the STEAM game store. The 
          store hosts about 10,000 games and has reviews from nearly 4 million game users. The website has a 
          product listings page that you can use to extract metadata of the games it hosts.
    - [ ] Recommended Web Scraping Tool: For this project, Python programming language’s Scrapy is a good option. 
          You can control the way you want to crawl the game store page using Scrapy’s CrawlSpider.
